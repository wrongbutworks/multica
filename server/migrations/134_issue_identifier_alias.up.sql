-- Issue identifier aliases: when an issue moves to another space it is
-- renumbered (numbers are per-space), so its old identifier (e.g. MUL-3)
-- would stop resolving. Every move records the pre-move identifier here so
-- identifier lookups (API/CLI, GitHub branch/PR auto-linking) can fall back
-- to the alias and land on the moved issue. Numbers are never reused
-- (issue_counter is monotonic), so an alias can never shadow a live issue.

-- Backfill aliases for the renaming migration 131 already performed. 131
-- normalized every workspace's legacy issue_prefix into a Space key
-- satisfying ^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]{0,6}$ (uppercase, strip non-alnum, truncate to 7).
-- Legacy prefixes longer than 7 chars, digit-first, or punctuated therefore
-- diverge from the key their issues now resolve under, and — unlike a
-- runtime move-to-space — that rename never went through the alias-writing
-- path above, since no issue actually changed space_id. Old links/CLI/GitHub
-- references using the pre-migration prefix would otherwise 404 forever.
-- workspace.issue_prefix is untouched by 131/132 (kept intentionally; see
-- 132's header comment), so the original value is still available here.
