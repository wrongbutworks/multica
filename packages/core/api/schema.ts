 * but never throw — the UI layer must keep rendering. This is the boundary
 * defense that turns "API contract drifted" from a white-screen incident
 * into a degraded-but-rendering page.
 *
 * The return type is anchored to `T` (inferred from `fallback`), not to the
 * schema's `z.infer` type. Schemas are intentionally **lenient** — string
 * enums kept as `z.string()` so an unknown enum value still parses, etc. —
 * so the parsed runtime value can be wider than the strict TS type at the
 * call site. The caller asserts compatibility by typing the fallback to the
 * expected `T`; downstream code is already responsible for handling unknown
 * enum values via `default`-bearing switches and optional chaining.
 *
 * See CLAUDE.md "API Response Compatibility" for when to reach for this.
